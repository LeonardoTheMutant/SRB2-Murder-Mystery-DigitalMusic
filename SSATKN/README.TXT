SQUARE SAW A TRIANGLE KNIFE NOISE
=================================
WARNING: This pack is not recommended for sensitive users as it might cause headaches

Digital Music Pack for LeonardoTheMutant's Murder Mystery add-on
By MinusMario (@mm8573) and @LeonardoTheMutant

A chiptune variation of the soundtrack based on PSG chips like NES APU, Commodore SID and others

MIDI tracks were digitalized with the help of LMMS and several soundfonts

If you can't find a sense in the name of the pack, it doesn't - it is simply a reference
to the wave types that most PSG chips can produce
